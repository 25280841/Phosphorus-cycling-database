# Phosphorus-cycling-database (PCyCDB)
This is a curated phosphorus cycling database (PCyCDB) with 117 gene families and 10 clusters. 
Homologous genes were added into the database to reduce the false positive rate. The criteria (i.e., identity, hit length) for filtering the alignment result generated by sequence similarity searching tools (e.g., BLAST, USEARCH, DIAMOND) were refined by identifying a known gene matrix and mock bacteria community to obtain the best accuracy and further reduction of false positives. The accuracy, PPV, sensitivity, specificity and NPV were 99.76%, 95.70%, 99.94%, 99.74% and 99.99%, respectively, at the 70% identity and 25 amino acid cutoffs. 
Importantly, the genes encode the intracellular phosphorus metabolic processes were added into PCyCDB, which should help researchers broaden the insights into not only the geochemical P cycling but also the microbial P metabolisms.
